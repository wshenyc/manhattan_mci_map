# Manhattan MCI Map

This is an interactive map displaying all buildings in Manhattan that had/have a Major Capital Improvements application with 
the New York State Division of Homes and Community Renewal (HCR) anytime from 2010-2020. 

## Data Sources

I submitted a FOIL request to HCR, who provided the data in .txt files. Despite the data being directly provided
by HCR, there were issues with the data not being complete in certain columns, which reduces the accuracy of the overall data,
especially for the aggregated data.

## Usage

People click a red square to see a detailed list of all the MCI items, including how much the landlord
claimed the improvement cost, how much HCR awarded them, when the MCI application was submitted and when it 
was ultimately approved if applicable. 

Secondly, someone can select a neighborhood they live in (divided based on Neighborhood Tabulation Areas)
and receive an overall aggregation of all the MCI data for their area, such as average MCI claim cost,
average MCI award amount, and most common MCI item.
